# Market News Sentiment Analysis

Analyze the sentiment of Hong Kong market news.\
The news are scrapped from [AASTOCKS](http://www.aastocks.com/), and the sentiment is determined by the users' (likely retail investors) rating on the articles.\
Several models will be used and evaluated to see which one is the best.
